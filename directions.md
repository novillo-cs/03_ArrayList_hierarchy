# LAB 04: ArrayList Hierarchy

**Directions:** Implement the classes NoNullArrayList and OrderedArrayList with
the following specifications. Use at least two test cases for each class to test your code.

## NoNullArrayList

- NoNullArrayList is-a ArrayList (NoNullArrayList inherits from ArrayList).
- ArrayList uses any type of data. You must implement that behavior in your
NoNullArrayList by declaring you class like this:

```
public class NoNullArrayList<T> extends ArrayList<T>{

}
```

- `<T>` indicates the generic type that will be used.
- Define two constructors: the default (no arguments) and the constructor with the
initialCapacity as an argument. This is a subclass, you should remember to call
the superclass constructor.
- Override these methods: add and set. Raise an exception IllegalArgumentException when a null value argument has been received.
If the argument received is not null, you must call the add method from the superclass.

## OrderedArrayList

- OrderedArrayList is-a NoNullArrayList (OrderedArrayList inherits from
NoNullArrayList).
- Your code should allow T to use the compareTo() method which compares an
object with another, and returns a numerical result based on the comparison. If
the result is negative, this object sorts less than the other; if 0, the two are equal,
and if positive, this object sorts greater than the other (Example: `o1.compareTo(o2)`)

```
public class OrderedArrayList<T extends Comparable<T>> extends NoNullArrayList<T>{

}
```

- `<T extends Comparable<T>>` means that the type T must implement the Comparable interface, which ensures objects of type T can be compared with one another.
- Define two constructors: the default (no arguments) and the constructor with the
initialCapacity as an argument. This is a subclass, you should remember to call
the superclass constructor
- Override these methods: add and set.
- The add methods must place the new element in the correct location. If a null
element is added, your code must add it anywhere so it throws an exception.
- The set method must remove the element at the target position and then call the
method add to insert a new element which will throw the correct exception if the
element is null (the exception should be the one thrown when super.add(null) is
called).

**Note:** compareTo() will throw an exception (NullPointerException) if comparing a null
value. This is not the correct exception to handle for this question.
